**Introduction**

<p align="justify">
IusCL is an Eclipse Plug-in that offers an application development style similar to Delphi7. It is built around a library containing a class hierarchy similar to VCL and based on SWT for the UI part. The library can be distributed with the developed applications, in the terms of the Eclipse Public License. The project is fully functional, but the documentation is only started. It should be installed as a normal Eclipse plug-in, and then its usage should hopefully be intuitive, as this is one of the goals of the project.
